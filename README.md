# Bouncing Ball
Assignment for cs1951U:

I like to be amused while I am waiting for my programs to compile or to run.  What I would like you to write is a Java program that displays a set of balls that bounce around in a window in an entertaining way that the user can control. 

### MVP Notes:

The MVP version implements all of the required basics except 9 (settings panel). The settings panel and additional features will be available in future updates.

Specification No. 10 is altered to "Balls start at a random position in the room and have zero initial velocity." This is found to be more entertaining in practice.



**To run the MVP:**

```bash
java -jar ./target/bouncingBall-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
